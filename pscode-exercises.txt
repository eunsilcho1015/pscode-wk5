// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1. Prompt the user to enter a number.
2. Read the entered number.
3. Check if the entered number is divisible by 2 without any remainder.
4. If the number is divisible by 2, print "Even"; otherwise, print "Odd".


// Exercise 3: Caculate Average, Minimum, and Maximum of Five Numbers   

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


1. Initialize variables sum, average, min, and max to zero.
2. Repeat the following steps five times:
   a) Prompt the user to enter a number.
   b) Read the entered number and add it to the sum.
   c) If the entered number is greater than max, set max to the entered number.
   d) If the entered number is less than min, set min to the entered number.
3. Calculate the average by dividing the sum by 5.
4. Print the average, min, and max along with appropriate messages describing what they represent.
